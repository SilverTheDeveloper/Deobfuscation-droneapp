ABSTRACT

In recent years, the proliferation of drones has significantly expanded their applications
across various domains, from recreational photography to critical infrastructure surveillance.
However, this rapid evolution has brought about new challenges, particularly in ensuring the
security and integrity of drone software. One of the key strategies employed to protect drone
applications from reverse engineering and tampering is obfuscation. Obfuscation techniques
aim to obscure the codebase, making it difficult for adversaries to understand the underlying
logic and extract sensitive information. While obfuscation serves as a fundamental defence
mechanism, it also poses challenges for developers and security analysts attempting to
analyse and verify the behaviour of drone applications. In response to the growing need for
understanding the intricacies of obfuscated drone software, this report delves into the realm
of deobfuscation and obfuscation techniques specific to Android-based drone applications.
By unravelling the layers of obfuscation employed in these applications, we aim to shed light
on the underlying functionalities and potential vulnerabilities , As utilization of obfuscation
techniques in Android applications poses a significant challenge in identifying tampered code
introduced by attackers or malware. As a consequence of obfuscation, the code becomes
obscured, complicating the process of identifying potential risks or malicious modifications.
Therefore, it becomes imperative to employ deobfuscation methods to revert the code to its
original form, enabling thorough analysis and scrutiny for any nefarious alterations. This
necessitates a meticulous approach to ensure the security and integrity of Android
applications in the face of evolving threats. We intend to raise awareness about the critical
role of deobfuscation in mitigating potential attacks on drone Android applications. By
bridging the gap between theory and practice in drone software security, we aspire to foster a
safer and more resilient ecosystem for the integration of drones across diverse applications.
Through this endeavor, developers, security analysts, and policymakers can be better
equipped to mitigate risks and ensure the integrity of drone technologies in contemporary
society.
